# 🛡️ Knight Platformer Game (Godot)

This is my **first game project using the Godot Engine** — a fun and simple 2D platformer where you control a knight to jump over obstacles, avoid enemies, and explore the level.

## 🎮 Game Features

- 2D side-scrolling platformer.
- Play as a pixel-art knight character.
- Platforming challenges, enemies, and obstacles.
- Built using **Godot** and **GDScript**.
